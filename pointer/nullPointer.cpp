int* p1, p2; // p1 is a pointer to int; p2 is an int

//References to Pointers

int *p; // p is a pointer to int
int *&r = p; // r is a reference to the pointer p
r = &i; // r refers to a pointer; assigning &i to r makes p point to i
*r = 0; // dereferencing r yields i, the object to which p points; changes i to 0
