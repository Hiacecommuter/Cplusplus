An abstract class
- class does not provide some implementation of all functions

A pure virtual function (or abstract function) in C++ is a virtual function
which must be overridden in the derived class.

A pure virtual function is declared by assigning 0 in declaration

// An abstract class
class Test
{   
    // Data members of class
public:
    // Pure Virtual Function
    virtual void show() = 0;
    
   /* Other members */
};

1. A class is abstract if it has at least one pure virtual function

2. We can points and references of abstract class type

3. If we do not override the pure virtual function in derived class
   Then derived class also becomes abstract class
class Base
{
public:
    virtual void show() = 0;
};
  
class Derived : public Base { };
  
int main(void)
{
  Derived d;
  return 0;
}

4. An asbtract class can have constractors

5. An abstract class in C+++ can also be defined using struct keyword
struct shapeClass
{
virtual void Draw()=0;
};
